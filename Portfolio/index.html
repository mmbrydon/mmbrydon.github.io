<h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
</a>
<hr>

<p>I was born in a small town in the Catskill Mountains. The air was fresh and the pH of the water a pure seven. My mother was expecting a boy to be named Wyatt.  Low and behold, she was blessed with a girl and, thankfully, I was not named Wyatt. Somehow, I escaped the philestine locals and made it to Manhattan. I have survived four years thus far, despite increasing rent costs that are, in fact, too damn high. Now, as a twenty-something, I write scripts and read scripts for free. </p>
